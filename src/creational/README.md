# Creational Patterns
## 1. Singleton Pattern
This pattern ensures that only one instance of a class is used. It needs global access through a method call, that instantiates its instance at its first call (lazy instantiation), or gets generated, when its class is loaded on the virtual machine (early instatiation).

### MySingleton: 
This is a Java-implementation of the Singleton design pattern with thread-safe instantiation through double-checked locking.

**ðŸ”’Why double-checked locking?**
- Saves performance through minimal synchronization
- volatile
